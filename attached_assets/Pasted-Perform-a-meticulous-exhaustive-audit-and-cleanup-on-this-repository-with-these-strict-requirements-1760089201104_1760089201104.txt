Perform a meticulous, exhaustive audit and cleanup on this repository with these strict requirements:
---
1. **Dependencies & `package.json`:**
   - Open `package.json`.
   - Remove all dependencies, devDependencies, and fields not strictly needed for a standard Node.js + TypeScript + Express backend, React + Vite frontend, and Drizzle ORM. Only keep packages required for these stacks.
   - Delete any dependency, devDependency, or script referencing "replit", "upm", "nix", "ghostwriter", or any platform/AI-specific tooling.
   - In scripts, keep only npm-standard commands: e.g., `"dev"`, `"start"`, `"build"`, `"test"`. Remove or rewrite any others to match typical developer workflows.
   - Remove any custom fields, metadata, or artifacts not found in clean open-source setups.

2. **Config & Platform Traces:**
   - Delete `.replit`, `replit.nix`, `.upm`, `.config`, or any hidden or visible Replit/platform-specific file or folder.
   - Remove all config, environment, or database connections designed for Replit usage—leave only standard `.env` and production-friendly config files.
   - Inside remaining config files, clear out any references or keys mentioning "replit" or similar terms.

3. **Lockfiles & Tooling:**
   - Ensure only `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml` (created using npm/yarn/pnpm) are present. Remove any nonstandard lockfiles.
   - Eliminate any vestigial dependencies or hooks from previous automated setup, including tools left by Replit or automated dependency managers.
   - Ensure all lockfiles reflect only the required stack and are compatible with an ordinary local build (`npm install`, `yarn install`).

4. **Documentation:**
   - Scrub all documentation (`README.md`, setup files, comments) for any mention of Replit, AI, platform-specific workflows, or nonstandard cloud platform instructions. Rewrite setup instructions for a standard VS Code, npm/yarn CLI, and localhost deployment process.

5. **Scripts & Environment:**
   - Make sure all scripts, configs, and environment steps are compatible with developers using VS Code or any mainstream local IDE.
   - In `.env.example` or related files, remove any platform-generated variables or API keys; provide only typical environment variable templates for local setups.

6. **Source Code and Imports:**
   - Remove any imports referencing or requiring platform tooling (Replit, upm, or similar).
   - Check for and remove watermark comments or auto-generated banners in every file.
   - Only idiomatic, standard code, and comments explaining logic where necessary—not generic or AI-patterned documentation.

7. **Vetting & Verification:**
   - Do a final project-wide search for "replit", "upm", "nix", "ghostwriter" and variants in all text and configuration files.
   - Confirm project will work with a clean `git clone`, `npm install`, and VS Code dev environment—no mention or dependency on "Replit" or nonstandard tools remains.

8. **Professional Polish:**
   - Add or update `.gitignore` for standard Node/React/TypeScript/Vite best practices.
   - Ensure all instructions and sample code snippets look like they come from a skilled senior developer, without auto-generated or low-quality code artifacts.

9. **Summary of Changes:**
   - After cleanup, generate a `CLEANUP_REPORT.md` at the project root briefly outlining what was removed or changed (dependency removals, script standardizations, config/file deletions, etc.).
---

**Result:**  
The finished project must look indistinguishable from a hand-built VS Code/Node.js/React/TypeScript repository, with no config, dependency, or metadata suggesting Replit, AI, or cloud platform development.
