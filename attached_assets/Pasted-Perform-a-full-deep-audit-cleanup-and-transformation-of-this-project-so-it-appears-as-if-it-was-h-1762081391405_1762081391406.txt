Perform a full, deep audit, cleanup, and transformation of this project so it appears as if it was hand-crafted by an expert developer using VS Code, **with zero trace of Replit, Replit AI, or any non-standard platform involvement**.

## 1. PACKAGE/DEPENDENCY SCRUTINY (`package.json` and similar)
- Open `package.json`:
  - Remove any dependencies or devDependencies not strictly required for a Node.js/TypeScript/React/Vite/Express/Drizzle ORM (or standard stack) project.
  - Eliminate all packages or fields related to Replit, e.g., `replit`, `replitPackages.*`, `upm`, `nix`, or any Replit-provisioned utilities.
  - Remove any platform-specific scripts or startup commands that reference "Replit" or dev environments unique to Replit. Keep only standard scripts like `"start"`, `"build"`, `"dev"`, `"test"`, and ensure these match standard Node.js/React workflow (`vite`, `tsc`, `node`, etc).
  - If present, remove "replit" or "nix" sections and any custom keys not found in typical open-source projects.
- Scan for any other package/config files (`yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, etc). Ensure only vanilla dependencies, nothing Replit-bundled.

## 2. FILE AND FOLDER CONFIGURATION
- Delete these files and folders, if present:
  - `.replit` (Replit config)
  - `replit.nix` (Nix/packaging for Replit)
  - Any `.upm/`, `.config/`, or similar folders tied to Replit or platform automation.
  - Any configuration for Replit's database or prop-based system not portable or compatible with non-Replit hosting.
- Remove any references to previously deleted files from `README.md` or docs.

## 3. SCRIPTS & ENVIRONMENT STANDARDIZATION
- Ensure all `scripts` in `package.json` do NOT mention Replit or platform hooks.
- Scripts should be compatible with VS Code, npm, or yarn CLI:
  - `"start"` should run the backend (e.g., `node ./path/to/server.js` or `ts-node ./src/server.ts`) or serve React app (e.g., `vite`, `react-scripts start`).
  - `"build"` for production build step.
  - `"dev"` for local developer mode.
- If there are `.env` or `.env.example` files:
  - Remove any environment variables referencing Replit.
  - Only include secrets, database URLs, API endpoints relevant to a normal developer environment.

## 4. DOCUMENTATION/README SCRUBBING
- Remove any documentation, comments, or badges referencing Replit, Replit workflows, Replit hosting URLs, or nonstandard platform details.
- Re-instruct setup for a normal Node.js/React project: e.g., `git clone`, `npm install`, `npm start`—no mention of Replit or unique online IDE steps.

## 5. CODE/IMPORTS SANITIZATION
- Remove all imports of Replit-specific or platform-only packages/utilities.
- Validate all import paths are standard (e.g., absolute or relative), with no hacks for special Replit file system quirks.

## 6. VSCODE AND DEV-ENVIRONMENT EMULATION
- Add a `.gitignore` file listing standard Node, React, and VS Code exclusions (e.g., `node_modules/`, `.env`, `.DS_Store`, `dist/`, `build/`).
- If not present, generate recommended project metadata files such as `tsconfig.json`, `jsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, with default settings for modern Node/React/TypeScript projects.
- Remove any unnecessary or extraneous config files—even custom Replit settings for editors, code insight, or project metadata.
- If present, update `.vscode/` to contain only generic recommended VS Code settings—no mention of Replit.

## 7. LOCKFILE & VERSION CONFORMITY
- Validate `package-lock.json` or equivalent lockfiles are generated by npm, yarn, or pnpm only—no files like `replit-lock.json` or platform-custom lockfiles.
- If outdated versions of core packages are present (outside of LTS/default npm recommendations), update to typical versions used by professional developers in 2025.

## 8. FINAL CHECK: ZERO AI/PLATFORM TRACES
- Scrub ALL code and configs for any string containing "replit", "upm", "nix", "ghostwriter", or other known AI-related internal markers.
- Remove any watermark comments or comments inserted by AI ("Generated by...", "Created with AI", etc.).
- Ensure all logs, comments, and code patterns are generic and idiomatic for a human developer.
- Review hidden files and folders to confirm no Replit or AI platform artifacts remain.

## 9. TEST AND VERIFY
- Prepare the cleaned project so that a developer can:
  - Clone the repo.
  - Run `npm install`.
  - Start the app through `npm run dev` or `npm start`.
  - Deploy on any standard Node/React-capable host without custom platform modifications.

## IMPORTANT
- Do not break existing app features or functionality in this cleanup.
- Document any significant changes you had to make in a `CLEANUP_REPORT.md` at the project root.

**Result:**  
The final codebase and configuration should be indistinguishable from a codebase created entirely in VS Code by a senior developer, with absolutely no traces of Replit, Replit-specific AI, or any unusual platform. All package management and environmental fingerprints must be standard, open-source, local-dev friendly, and audit-passing.

Begin this process now.
